# TikZ_Bistatic_Radar_Astrodynamics
TikZ drawings of bistatic radar &amp; astrodynamics scenarios

This repo contains LaTeX files which draw figures in radar (more specifically, bistatic radar), astrodynamics/orbital mechanics and resident space object (RSOs: satellites and space debris) tracking.

## Mission Planning Tool for Space Debris Studies with the MeerKAT Radar
I created these figures for my master's dissertation [Mission Planning Tool for Space Debris Studies with the MeerKAT radar](https://open.uct.ac.za/handle/11427/29617). Some of these figures also featured in a [conference paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8835735) presented at the 2019 IEEE Radar Conference (RadarConf) in Boston, USA. The source files for the conference paper are in a [public repo](https://github.com/AshivDhondea/ashiv_2019_radar_conf).

## Credits
Most of these LaTeX scripts started with some starter code or examples from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tikz) and [TeXample](http://www.texample.net/) which I edited further or adapted to suit my purposes. I will update reference links as time goes by. Let me know if you are the author of the original code snippet.
